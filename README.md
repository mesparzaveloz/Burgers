### How The App Should Work
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that allows users to enter their preferred burger.
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will be transferred to the right side of the page.
Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
